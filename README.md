**The library "d2l" is made by DIDL writers**  
**This only helps visualizing graphs**  
**Usually the most codes and notebooks in the repo just copied from the book for studying**  
**And I made this repo for searching the code whenever i need to use**  
**If you have any problems or questions email me :)**
